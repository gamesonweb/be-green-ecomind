## General description

Welcome to EcoMind, an underwater adventure designed to inspire environmental consciousness and ignite your passion for a greener future. Dive into the depths of the ocean and join the community of eco-warriors on a mission to save our precious marine ecosystem.

Equipped with your virtual diving gear, you'll embark on exciting expeditions to collect trash such as plastic bottles and cans that threaten the ocean. As time ticks away, you'll race against the clock to gather as much as possible to finish the mission. 

As you progress, you'll unlock new equipment and face new challenges. Each Eequipment locked is made of recycled plastic and cans that you are collecting from the water.

Ultimately, your goal in EcoMind is to complete all the missions and earn the prestigious EcoMind Trophy, symbolizing your readiness to make a lasting difference for a greener future and bring positive change to our planet.

### Personal Message

This was the first time I developed a game on website, and I gave it all my passion, dedication, and knowledge in the field of web development. I focused on every single detail, from user interface, to user experience, to a smooth and easy navigating in the game, to design and music. 
Every single model or design is customised for this game, so I hope you will like this work of ART.
